# (IN PROGRESS) CrimeDrop – A User Friendly FBI Lookup Tool 👮
CrimeDrop is a super simple web app that can be used to lookup various people on the FBI's most wanted list. I've built this to be as developer friendly as possible - it's designed to be cloned and studied - from accessing API's to mapping and navigating (mostly for my own sake 😄).

This is still in development so there will certainly be parts that aren't working as intended.

I've been as generous as possible with comments (so far),  but I still haven't got them exactly how I'd like them - so not everything might be commented.

Contributions are currently closed - sorry!



## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, ReactRouter, TailwindCSS, Axios.

**Backend:** Firebase, although just for hosting.

I'm intentionally trying to avoid using packages, so stuff I'd typically used, like Bootstrap or AntD isn't included.



## Roadmap

✅ Inital Config

✅ Loading data from FBI

✅ Loading detailed data from API (routed via react-router)

👨‍💻 Pagination

❌ Search & Filter

❌ Advanced lookup
